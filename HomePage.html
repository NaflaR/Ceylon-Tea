                                Ceylon (say-lawn) tea is a tea made in the island nation of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon.
                                Sri Lanka is small, but it has an incredible variety of elevation, climate, soil type, plant varieties,
                                and weather, so the flavors and character of the teas produced there vary a lot. Despite the regional 
                                variations, the classic Ceylon flavor is commonly thought to be bold, complete and brittle. It has medium to full 
                                tannins and several notes of citrus, chocolate, or spice.
                                <br>
                                Ceylon teas are made from the dried leaves of tea plant called Camellia sinensis. The leaves are often characterized 
                                as wiry because they are left long and thin with a wire-like appearance. These leaves are very easy to identify in the 
                                world of tea. Most Ceylon Tea is orthodox tea, which means that it was processed by hand,
                                making a simple, bright tea.
